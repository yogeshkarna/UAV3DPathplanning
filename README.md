># UAV Path Planning in 3D Unstructured Environment
> ## Author: Yogeshkarna Govindaraj
### Introduction 
This repository contains implementation of UAV 3D Path planning algorithms. The global path planning algorithm based on Simulated Annealing (SA) and local path planning algorithms I-PRM and A*. For Lazy-Theta* the recent implementation by [1] is used by modifying the dataset. 

The original pointcloud files of datasets are too large for github repository, The `.pcd` files can be downloaded into `dataset` folder from below link.

### Installation
The project is developed in `anaconda` environment. The `requirements.yml` file contans all the dependencies required to run all path planning programs contained in `src` folder. 
```python
conda env update -n my_env --file requirements.yml
```
The above command creates a new anaconda environment named `my_env` consisting of all the dependencies required to run the path planners.

### Repository structure
`dataset` folder contains `octomap` files of all three datasets used for testing the local path planning algorithms. The `src` folder contains three `.ipynb` files where `SA` implements the global path planning solution, `A-star` and `I-PRM` files implements the respective local path planning algorithm. 

All these programs are standalone containing program explanation within. For Lazy-Theta* an method proposed by [1]  is used, which can be found in the link below.
